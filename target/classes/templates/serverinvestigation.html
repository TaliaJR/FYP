<p> When an e-mail is sent, it is not sent directly to the recipient's mail box but to the sender's SMTP server instead.
From here, the SMTP server sends the e-mail to the recipient's e-mail server. Due to SMTP's servers not authenicating
the sender(the e-mail address is not checked if it is valid or not), some information in the e-mail header can be forged,
making it difficult to find the real identity of the sender. If the sender's information is valid, data relating to the
owner such as their credit card information can be found within their SMTP server which can help reveal their identity.
Server investigation uses a lot of resources due to the amount of processing needed to find any useful information.
There are ways of checking whether an e-mail is valid by looking at the metadata in the e-mail header. For example, if
the e-mail claims that it was sent from a e-mail address with a yahoo domain but the e-mail server information shows
that the e-mail was first received by a google e-mail server, it is likely that the e-mail address was forged. Another
example to look out for would be if a e-mail was sent from an e-mail address of a British bank but the IP address shows
    that it was sent from an IP address in Russia, the e-mail address is likely to have been forged. Banks can
have IT resources in different locations so in this case it would be useful to investigate where they can operate from.</p>
